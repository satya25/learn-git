## ðŸ§ª Testing Goals
- Validate push/pop operations
- Ensure peek returns correct record
- Confirm update/delete work as expected

## ðŸ“‚ File Mapping
- Implementation: `src/stack.c`
- Header: `include/stack.h`
- Tests: `tests/test_stack.c`

## ðŸ’¡ Notes
- Use dynamic memory allocation
- Avoid global variables
- Follow modular coding practices
