---

### **Slide 8: Installing Git**
- Windows: Git Bash  
- macOS: Homebrew  
- Linux: apt/yum  
- Verify: `git --version`

---

### **Slide 9: Setting Up Git**
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

---

### **Slide 10: Create a Local Project**
```bash
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
touch main.c
```

---

### **Slide 11: Initialize Git**
```bash
git init
```
- Creates `.git` folder  
- Starts tracking changes

---

### **Slide 12: Stage & Commit**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
- `add` stages changes  
- `commit` saves a version

---

### **Slide 13: View Status & Log**
```bash
git status
git log
```
- See whatâ€™s changed  
- View commit history

---

### **Slide 14: Create Remote Repo on GitHub**
- Go to [github.com](https://github.com)  
- Click "New Repository"  
- Name it, keep it public/private  
- Copy HTTPS URL

---

### **Slide 15: Connect Local to Remote**
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/learn-git-yourname.git
```

---

### **Slide 16: Push to GitHub**
```bash
git push -u origin main
```
- First push sets upstream  
- Future pushes: `git push`

---

### **Slide 17: Check on GitHub**
- Visit your repo  
- See files, commits, README  
- Share URL with peers

---

### **Slide 18: Make Changes Locally**
- Edit `main.c`  
- Add new feature  
- Save file

---

### **Slide 19: Commit Changes**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added search feature"
git push
```

---

### **Slide 20: Version History**
- Use `git log`  
- Each commit has:
  - Hash  
  - Author  
  - Message  
  - Timestamp

---

### **Slide 21: Clone a Repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/peername/project.git
```
- Creates a local copy  
- You can explore or contribute

---

### **Slide 22: Pull Latest Changes**
```bash
git pull
```
- Syncs your local repo with remote  
- Useful before pushing

---

### **Slide 23: Push Your Changes**
```bash
git push
```
- Sends your commits to GitHub  
- Others can now see your updates

---

### **Slide 24: Branching Basics**
```bash
git checkout -b feature-xyz
```
- Create a new branch  
- Work without affecting `main`

---

### **Slide 25: Merging Branches**
```bash
git checkout main
git merge feature-xyz
```
- Combines changes  
- Resolves conflicts if needed

---

### **Slide 26: Conflict Demo**
- Two people edit same line  
- Git flags conflict  
- You resolve manually

---

### **Slide 27: .gitignore**
- Prevents tracking of unwanted files  
- Example:
```
*.exe
*.log
build/
```

---

### **Slide 28: README.md**
- Explains project purpose  
- First thing collaborators read  
- Use Markdown formatting

---
